- Enable/disable toggle (persisted in localStorage)
- Graceful fallback if sounds are missing
- Respects browser autoplay policies

## Testing the Sounds

Once you've added the sound files, you can test them:

1. Open the Transactions page
2. Click the "ðŸŽ‰ Test Celebration" button (in development mode)
3. Or trigger a real transaction to hear the sounds

## Volume Guidelines

Default volumes are set to be pleasant and not jarring:
- Background sounds: 20-30%
- Action sounds: 30-40%
- Big celebration sounds: 40-50%

Users can adjust the global volume or disable sounds entirely through the sound toggle button in the UI.

3. Verify file names match exactly (case-sensitive)
4. Test with different browsers (Chrome/Firefox/Safari)
5. Check browser autoplay policies (user interaction may be required)
