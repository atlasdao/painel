## Testing Recommendations

1. **Visual Inspection**:
   - Open withdrawals page and verify all text is readable
   - Create a new withdrawal request and check form visibility
   - Open payment links page and create a new link
   - Verify modal has proper dark background and readable text

2. **Form Interactions**:
   - Test input fields for proper placeholder visibility
   - Verify dropdown options are readable
   - Check button hover states work correctly

3. **Cross-Browser Testing**:
   - Test in Chrome, Firefox, and Safari
   - Verify dark theme consistency across browsers

## Result
Both pages now have consistent dark theme styling with proper text contrast for readability. All user interface elements are clearly visible against dark backgrounds, matching the design system of the rest of the application.

## Additional Notes
- The fixes ensure consistency with the existing dark theme used throughout the Atlas Panel application
- All text elements now have explicit color classes to prevent browser default colors from interfering
- The modal styling now matches the pattern used in other admin pages like the marketing/coupons page
