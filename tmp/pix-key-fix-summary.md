# PIX Key Display Fix - Summary

## Issue
The PIX key was not showing in the Settings > Carteira page but was showing correctly in the Withdrawals page.

## Root Cause
- The Withdrawals page uses `/api/v1/profile` endpoint (handled by ProfileController/ProfileService)
- The Settings page uses `/auth/profile` endpoint (handled by AuthController/AuthService)
- The AuthService's `getUserProfile` method was not returning the `pixKey` and `pixKeyType` fields

## Solution Applied
Updated `/Volumes/NEWATLAS/Drive/DEV/Atlas Painel/Atlas-API/src/auth/auth.service.ts` to include the missing fields:

```typescript
// Added to the result object in getUserProfile method (lines 427-428):
pixKey: user.pixKey || null,
pixKeyType: user.pixKeyType || null,
```

## Files Modified
- `/Volumes/NEWATLAS/Drive/DEV/Atlas Painel/Atlas-API/src/auth/auth.service.ts`
  - Added `pixKey` and `pixKeyType` fields to the profile response object

## Testing
After this change:
1. The NestJS server will automatically rebuild (it's running with --watch flag)
2. The Settings > Carteira page will now receive and display the PIX key fields
3. Both Settings and Withdrawals pages will show consistent PIX key information

## No Additional Changes Required
- Frontend is already configured to receive and display these fields (lines 118 and 126 in settings/page.tsx)
- No database changes needed (fields already exist in User model)
- No other API changes needed
